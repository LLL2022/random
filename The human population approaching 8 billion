Children of our world, we are nearing eight billion relatives. Please enjoy this moment. Within the following days, a historic moment in history will be in place.

Join us in the celebration. This is the eight milestone of the current order, with respect to human population.

You, perhaps, may not recall, or have experienced a past form of this milestone achievement. 1 Billion was achieved in the early 19th century. 2 Billion in the 1930s. The baby boom drastically increased human population.

Most, if not nearly all of us, are below the age of 25, for which yielding this as the third milestone, among 6 Billion in 1998 and 7 Billion in 2010. Most of you will also have not been experiencing the prior of these two. And possibly not recall the second moment.

And perhaps, the next milestone of 9 Billion will be another big one with equal importance, and the 10 Billion of even greater impact.

But of what certainty are we?
Of what certainty? 
Of what certainty is it that we will experience a population as great as 10 Billion?

It is well known, that the population, will reach a maximum. At that point, by law of diminishing returns, we will not have enough resources to support ourselves. Diminished population will then be in place.

However, of what magnitude is this such maximum? Many believe it to be 10 Billion. It could be less.

So of what certainty can we assume of this event being less eventful than a further one in the future?
Of what certainty?

It is thus that I cordially invite all of you to join us in the celebration of such a historic moment.

Possibly the penultimate.
Possibly the last.
Possibly neither, but of what certainty?
